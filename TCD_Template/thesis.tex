%%% This file contains a template that can be used with the package

%%% All of the commands defined by utthesis.sty have default values (see

%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,
%%% and uncomment the line (by removing the leading %'s).

\begin{thesisabstract}

\textbf{Abstract:} Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a communication approach that 
makes content 'living' in a network the focus of communication, in 
contrast to the traditional communication between hosts based on IP 
addresses. In order to ensure the validity of content, it should be 
signed by its producer and  in order to ensure that information is only 
accessible to a select number of consumers, content may need to be 
encrypted. Named-Data Networking (NDN) is an ICN implementation that 
provides a framework for the exchange of named content and a 
certificate-based security mechanism to sign and encrypt/decrypt 
content. The certificates in NDN are held at individual nodes and have 
to be requested by other nodes in a network in order to verify content, 
leading to additional latency once content has been retrieved.

This project has extended NDN's certificate management system by 
distributing certificates based on a distributed ledger i.e. a 
blockchain. Transactions such as the creation and removal are announced 
by nodes to miners which incorporate the transaction into new blocks and 
distribute these to nodes for inclusion into the Blockchain. Nodes have 
access to the current set of certificates through their Blockchain and 
can verify content through these certificates.

NDN currently implements a signature verification standard by defining a common certificate format. All signed data transfers in NDN are certificates because they contain a public key.X509 Format.
